## Introduction

- Remote sensing involves collecting data about Earth's surface without physical contact.

- Example: Using a satellite to monitor deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.

So, in conclusion, remote sensing is much more than just satellite data. It is a process to obtain information about objects or areas without direct contact. The data can be in various formats, including 2D and 3D.

### Examples of Remote Sensing Technologies

- **Satellite**: Provides large-scale data for applications like weather monitoring, environmental changes, or urban growth.
- **Drone**: Useful for small areas, providing high-resolution imagery for precision agriculture or construction monitoring.
- **Autonomous Cars**: Use LiDAR and cameras for mapping surroundings in real-time.
- **X-Ray**: Used in hospitals to image the human body without physical contact.

---

## Electromagnetic Spectrum

The electromagnetic spectrum is divided into different bands based on wavelength. These bands are used in remote sensing to detect various features of the Earth's surface.

### Key Components:

- **Visible Light**: What humans can see; used for natural colour imagery.
- **Infrared**: Used for detecting vegetation health and surface temperatures.
- **Microwave**: Used in RADAR for all-weather imaging.

---

### What is a Band?
A **band** is a specific range of wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum that a sensor can detect. Bands are critical for remote sensing as they capture specific details based on how objects reflect or emit radiation in these wavelengths.

- **Example**: The Landsat 8 satellite has multiple bands, including:
  - Band 4 (Red): Used for vegetation studies.
  - Band 5 (Near-Infrared): Highlights healthy vegetation.
  - Band 10 (Thermal Infrared): Detects surface temperatures.

Sensors record data in different bands, which can be combined to generate meaningful insights. For example, NDVI uses the Red and NIR bands to monitor vegetation health.

---

## What is Geospatial?

The term **geospatial** refers to data that includes a geographic component, meaning it is tied to a location on Earth. Geospatial data can be represented in two main forms:

1. **Vector Data**: Points, lines, and polygons.
   - Example: Roads, rivers, or building footprints.
2. **Raster Data**: Grid-based data where each cell (pixel) has a value.
   - Example: Satellite imagery, elevation models.

Geospatial technologies integrate this data to solve real-world problems like disaster management, urban planning, and resource mapping.

---

## Active vs. Passive Remote Sensing

- **Passive**: Captures natural radiation from the Sun.
  - Example: Landsat satellites use sunlight to capture surface imagery.
- **Active**: Emits its own energy and measures the reflected signal.
  - Example: RADAR and LiDAR systems can operate at night and in cloudy conditions.

**Further Explanation**:
- Passive systems rely on external energy sources (e.g., the Sun), making them dependent on daylight and clear skies.
- Active systems generate their own energy, making them ideal for all-weather, day-and-night imaging.

---

## Resolution

- **Spatial Resolution**: Refers to the size of one pixel in an image.
  - Example: Sentinel-2 with a 10m resolution can identify features like buildings.
  - A 10m resolution means that one pixel represents a 10x10m area on the ground.

- **High Resolution**: Imagery with finer detail.
  - Example: WorldView-3 satellite images can identify vehicles.

**More Examples**:
- **30m Resolution**: Landsat imagery for environmental studies.
- **Sub-meter Resolution**: Commercial satellites like WorldView for urban planning.

Other types of resolution include:

- **Spectral Resolution**: Number of bands a sensor can detect.
- **Temporal Resolution**: How often a sensor revisits the same location.
- **Radiometric Resolution**: Ability to differentiate small differences in reflectance.

---

## Applications of Remote Sensing

1. **Environmental Monitoring**
   - Mapping land use, detecting forest loss, and monitoring pollution.
   - Example: Detecting oil spills in oceans using SAR imagery.

2. **Urban Planning**
   - Monitoring city growth and infrastructure.
   - Example: High-resolution imagery to detect illegal constructions.

3. **Agriculture**
   - Monitoring crop health using indices like NDVI.

## Units, Pixel Values, and Band Analysis

### Units in Remote Sensing
- **Wavelength**: Measured in micrometers (µm) or nanometers (nm). For example:
  - Visible light: 0.4–0.7 µm.
  - Near-infrared: 0.7–1.4 µm.
- **Spatial Resolution**: Measured in meters. It represents the ground area covered by one pixel. For example:
  - 10m resolution means each pixel covers a 10x10 meter area.
  - Sub-meter resolution (e.g., 0.5m) provides very fine detail, capturing objects as small as cars.
  
### Pixel Values in Bands
- Each pixel in a band represents a specific radiometric value, often a measure of reflectance or intensity of the detected electromagnetic radiation.
  - Example: In the NIR band, vegetation pixels will have high values because vegetation reflects a lot of near-infrared light.
  
### Band Analysis
- **Single Band Analysis**: Examining one band to detect specific features.
  - Example: Thermal band to measure surface temperature.
- **Multi-Band Analysis**: Combining multiple bands for advanced indices or classification.
  - Example: Combining Red and NIR bands to calculate NDVI.

## NDVI: Understanding in Detail

### What is NDVI?
NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is a widely used spectral index to measure vegetation health and density. It uses reflectance values from the Red and Near-Infrared (NIR) bands.

### Formula:
\[
NDVI = \frac{(NIR - Red)}{(NIR + Red)}
\]

### How It Works:
- **Healthy Vegetation**:
  - Absorbs most of the red light (low Red reflectance).
  - Reflects most of the NIR light (high NIR reflectance).
  - NDVI values are close to +1.
- **Unhealthy or Sparse Vegetation**:
  - Reflects more red light and less NIR light.
  - NDVI values are close to 0 or negative.

### NDVI Value Range:
- **+1 to 0.5**: Dense, healthy vegetation.
- **0.5 to 0.2**: Sparse or stressed vegetation.
- **0.2 to 0.0**: Bare soil.
- **0.0 to -1**: Non-vegetative surfaces like water, snow, or built-up areas.

### Example Applications:
1. **Agriculture**: Monitor crop health to identify drought stress or nutrient deficiencies.
2. **Forestry**: Track deforestation or monitor forest health.
3. **Urban Planning**: Detect green spaces in cities.

### Visualization:
- NDVI maps are often colour-coded:
  - Green: High NDVI (dense vegetation).
  - Yellow/Orange: Medium NDVI (sparse vegetation).
  - Red/Blue: Low or negative NDVI (bare soil, water).

---

## High Resolution: What It Means

High resolution refers to the level of detail in a remote sensing image. It is primarily determined by **spatial resolution**.

### Explanation:
- A **high-resolution image** has smaller pixel sizes, representing finer details on the ground.
  - Example:
    - 30m resolution (Landsat): Each pixel represents a 30x30 meter area, suitable for regional-scale studies.
    - 10m resolution (Sentinel-2): Each pixel represents a 10x10 meter area, providing better detail.
    - Sub-meter resolution (WorldView-3): Pixels smaller than 1 meter, capable of distinguishing small objects like vehicles.

### Applications of High-Resolution Imagery:
1. **Urban Studies**: Detecting building footprints, roads, or even cars.
2. **Agriculture**: Precision farming to monitor small field variations.
3. **Disaster Management**: Identifying damage at the building level after an earthquake.
4. **Environmental Monitoring**: Tracking fine-scale deforestation patterns.

### Challenges:
- **Storage**: High-resolution data requires more storage space.
- **Processing**: Requires more computational power for analysis.
- **Cost**: High-resolution imagery is often more expensive.

By understanding these concepts, users can select appropriate resolutions and bands based on their analysis requirements.
