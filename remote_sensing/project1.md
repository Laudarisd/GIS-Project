## Introduction to the Problem

- **Methane emissions and cultural significance**: Methane (CH₄) is a potent greenhouse gas, with a warming potential over 80 times that of CO₂ over 20 years, making it a critical focus for climate mitigation. Agricultural activities, particularly livestock farming, are significant methane sources, often embedded within Indigenous communities’ economic and cultural practices. These communities view land stewardship as a traditional responsibility, intertwining environmental sustainability with cultural heritage. The challenge is to map these diffuse emissions using MethaneSat—a satellite launched in 2024 with advanced methane detection capabilities—while incorporating Indigenous knowledge to ensure culturally sensitive analysis and solutions. This dual approach seeks to reduce emissions while honoring traditional land management practices.

- **Example Context**: Methane emissions from pastoral farming vary with livestock density and Indigenous land use practices, requiring a tailored mapping strategy.

## Proposed Solutions

- **Strategies for mapping and mitigation**:  
  1. **Remote Sensing with MethaneSat**: Utilize MethaneSat’s high-sensitivity imagery (broad swath, ~1-3 km resolution) to detect methane concentrations, pinpointing emission hotspots in agricultural areas.  
  2. **Ground-Based Validation**: Deploy sensors and collect farm-specific data to refine satellite estimates and ensure accuracy.  
  3. **Cultural Collaboration**: Partner with Indigenous communities to integrate traditional knowledge (e.g., seasonal land use patterns) into emission models, aligning with cultural values.  
  4. **Advanced Analytics**: Apply machine learning and statistical modeling to attribute emissions to specific sources and predict trends.  
  5. **Mitigation Recommendations**: Offer data-driven insights for sustainable practices (e.g., feed adjustments, land restoration) that respect Indigenous traditions.  

- **Example Solution**: Using MethaneSat to identify a methane hotspot in a farming area, validated by ground data, and suggesting culturally appropriate mitigation like native vegetation restoration.

## Research Methods

- **Data Collection, Analysis, and Modeling**:  
  1. **Data Sources**:  
     - **MethaneSat Imagery**: Methane concentration maps from the satellite (available post-2025 via cloud platforms).  
     - **Ground Data**: Livestock counts, soil characteristics, weather records, and emission flux measurements from agricultural sites.  
     - **Cultural Data**: Traditional knowledge and land use practices from Indigenous community archives or oral histories.  
  2. **Preprocessing**:  
     - Correct MethaneSat data for atmospheric effects (e.g., water vapor) using radiometric tools.  
     - Align satellite and ground datasets with GIS software.  
  3. **Analysis**:  
     - **Inverse Modeling**: Combine top-down (satellite) and bottom-up (ground) data to estimate emission rates.  
     - **Machine Learning**: Train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision transformers to detect plumes and classify sources (e.g., livestock vs. natural features).  
     - **Statistical Modeling**: Use Bayesian methods to incorporate uncertainties from cultural and environmental factors.  
  4. **Visualization**: Produce heatmaps and 3D emission profiles for Indigenous stakeholders using open-source plotting tools.  

- **Example Method**: Preprocess MethaneSat data, use a CNN to detect plumes, and overlay results with farm boundaries in a GIS platform.

## Anticipated Challenges

- **Technical, Cultural, and Environmental Hurdles**:  
  1. **Technical Challenges**:  
     - **Coarse Resolution**: MethaneSat’s ~1-3 km resolution may miss small-scale emissions, necessitating fusion with finer data (e.g., drones).  
     - **Signal Noise**: Atmospheric interference (e.g., clouds, aerosols) can obscure methane signals, requiring advanced filtering.  
     - **Data Processing**: Large satellite datasets demand significant computational resources.  
  2. **Cultural Challenges**:  
     - **Engagement**: Researchers must demonstrate cultural sensitivity and respect Indigenous protocols to foster collaboration.  
     - **Data Ownership**: Indigenous communities may assert control over emission data, limiting external use.  
  3. **Environmental Challenges**:  
     - **Diffuse Sources**: Agricultural methane is dispersed, unlike point-source emissions, complicating detection.  
     - **Temporal Dynamics**: Seasonal farming cycles and weather variations affect emission patterns.  

- **Example Challenge**: Cloud cover reduces MethaneSat accuracy, requiring cultural consultation to interpret ground data as an alternative.

## Novel Mathematical Model: Methane Emission Source Attribution Model (MESAM)

- **Objective**: Attribute methane emissions to specific sources (e.g., livestock, soil, natural features) in Indigenous agricultural contexts, integrating satellite, ground, and cultural data for predictive and culturally informed analysis.

- **Formulation**:  
  Define \( E(x, t) \) as the methane emission rate (kg CH₄/h) at location \( x \) and time \( t \):  
  \[
  E(x, t) = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i S_i(x, t) + \alpha C(x, t) + \beta M(x, t) + \epsilon(x, t)
  \]
  Where:  
  - \( S_i(x, t) \): Emission contribution from source \( i \) (e.g., livestock \( S_1 \), soil \( S_2 \)), modeled as:  
    \[
    S_i(x, t) = k_i D_i(x) \cdot f_i(t)
    \]
    - \( k_i \): Emission factor (e.g., kg CH₄/unit/day).  
    - \( D_i(x) \): Spatial density (e.g., units/km²).  
    - \( f_i(t) \): Temporal factor (e.g., seasonal activity intensity).  
  - \( C(x, t) \): Cultural influence (e.g., traditional land practices), weighted by \( \alpha \).  
  - \( M(x, t) \): MethaneSat concentration (ppm), scaled by \( \beta \).  
  - \( \epsilon(x, t) \): Error term for noise and unmodeled effects.  
  - \( w_i \): Adaptive weights optimized via machine learning.

- **Novelty**:  
  - **Cultural Integration**: Quantitatively incorporates Indigenous knowledge (\( C(x, t) \)), a rare feature in emission models.  
  - **Dynamic Weighting**: Uses ML-trained \( w_i \) to adaptively prioritize sources, improving over static models.  
  - **Diffuse Emission Focus**: Designed for dispersed agricultural emissions, enhancing source-specific accuracy.

- **Implementation**:  
  - **Training**: Optimize \( w_i \), \( \alpha \), and \( \beta \) using Bayesian inference or a neural network on fused data.  
  - **Prediction**: Input real-time data to estimate \( E(x, t) \) and source contributions.  
  - **Example**: MESAM attributes 60% of methane to livestock, 20% to soil, and 15% influenced by cultural practices in an agricultural area.

- **Future Use**: Enables scenario analysis (e.g., mitigation impacts) and long-term emission monitoring with cultural sensitivity.

## Expected Outcomes and Future Directions

- **Impact and next steps**:  
  - **Scientific Contribution**: Establish a reliable method for mapping agricultural methane with MethaneSat, validated by ground data, and enhanced by MESAM.  
  - **Climate Impact**: Support Indigenous communities in reducing methane emissions, contributing to broader climate goals.  
  - **Cultural Benefit**: Empower Indigenous stakeholders with data control and culturally aligned mitigation strategies.  
  - **Scalability**: Adapt methods for other Indigenous or agricultural contexts globally.  
  - **Next Steps**: Conduct a pilot study in an Indigenous farming area, refine MESAM with community feedback, and share findings to advance climate research in Indigenous frameworks.

- **Example Outcome**: A heatmap of methane hotspots guides an Indigenous community to adopt sustainable practices, reducing emissions by an estimated 10% over two years.
