## Introduction

- **Overview and goals of remote sensing**: Remote sensing involves collecting data about Earth's surface without physical contact, using sensors on platforms like satellites, drones, or aircraft. Its goals include monitoring environmental changes, mapping resources, and supporting decision-making across fields like agriculture, urban planning, and disaster management. For example, satellites monitor deforestation in the Amazon, while drones assess crop health in precision agriculture. Remote sensing extends beyond imagery to include 2D and 3D data, enabling detailed spatial analysis.

### Examples of Remote Sensing Technologies
- **Satellite**: Large-scale data for weather forecasting (e.g., NOAA satellites) or land use mapping (e.g., Landsat).
- **Drone**: High-resolution imagery for small areas, like monitoring construction sites or wildlife habitats.
- **Autonomous Cars**: LiDAR and cameras for real-time navigation and mapping.
- **X-Ray**: Non-invasive imaging in medical applications, analogous to remote sensing principles.

## Electromagnetic Spectrum

- **Understanding wavelengths and bands**: The electromagnetic spectrum is divided into bands based on wavelength, each suited for specific remote sensing tasks. Key components include:
  - **Visible Light** (0.4–0.7 µm): Captures natural color imagery, e.g., RGB photos from Sentinel-2.
  - **Infrared** (0.7–14 µm): Detects vegetation health (Near-Infrared, NIR) or heat (Thermal Infrared), e.g., Landsat thermal bands.
  - **Microwave** (1 mm–1 m): Enables RADAR imaging through clouds, e.g., Sentinel-1 SAR.

### What is a Band?
A **band** is a range of wavelengths a sensor detects, revealing unique surface properties. For example, Landsat 8 bands include:
- **Band 4 (Red, 0.64–0.67 µm)**: Vegetation studies.
- **Band 5 (NIR, 0.85–0.88 µm)**: Highlights healthy plants.
- **Band 10 (Thermal, 10.6–11.19 µm)**: Measures surface temperature. Combining bands (e.g., Red + NIR for NDVI) provides actionable insights.

---

## Active vs. Passive Remote Sensing

- **Differences and applications**:
  - **Passive**: Relies on natural energy (e.g., sunlight), capturing reflected or emitted radiation. Example: Landsat uses sunlight for daytime land imaging, limited by weather and daylight.
  - **Active**: Emits its own energy and measures the return signal, ideal for all conditions. Example: SAR (Sentinel-1) maps terrain at night, while LiDAR creates 3D elevation models (e.g., forest canopy mapping).

---

## Resolution

- **Spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric aspects**:
  - **Spatial Resolution**: Pixel size on the ground. Sentinel-2 (10m) resolves buildings; WorldView-3 (0.31m) identifies cars.
  - **Spectral Resolution**: Number of detectable bands. Hyperspectral sensors (e.g., AVIRIS) offer hundreds of bands for detailed material identification.
  - **Temporal Resolution**: Revisit frequency. MODIS (daily) tracks rapid changes; Landsat (16 days) suits slower trends.
  - **Radiometric Resolution**: Sensitivity to energy differences (e.g., 8-bit = 256 levels, 16-bit = 65,536 levels).

**Examples**:
- 30m (Landsat) for regional studies.
- Sub-meter (Maxar) for urban detail.

## Applications of Remote Sensing

- **Real-world use cases across domains**:
  1. **Environmental Monitoring**: Mapping deforestation (e.g., Amazon using Landsat) or ocean pollution (SAR for oil spills).
  2. **Urban Planning**: Tracking city expansion (e.g., WorldView imagery for illegal constructions).
  3. **Agriculture**: Assessing crop health (e.g., NDVI from Sentinel-2 for drought detection).
  4. **Disaster Management**: Monitoring wildfires (e.g., MODIS thermal data) or flood extent (SAR).
  5. **Climate Studies**: Tracking ice melt (e.g., NSIDC data for Arctic sea ice).

## Data Types

- **Formats and structures of remote sensing data**:
  - **Shapefiles**: Vector data (points, lines, polygons) for roads or boundaries.
  - **Geodatabases**: Store spatial and attribute data (e.g., ArcGIS format).
  - **Raster Data**: Grid-based imagery (e.g., TIFF from satellites).
  - **3D Models**: Digital elevation models (DEMs) or point clouds from LiDAR.
  - **Coordinate Systems**: Define geographic reference (e.g., WGS84).

---

## GIS Spatial Data Integration

- **Combining remote sensing with GIS**: Integrates remote sensing imagery with GIS layers (e.g., roads, elevation) for enhanced analysis. Example: Overlaying Sentinel-2 imagery with DEMs in QGIS to model flood risk, combining raster and vector data for comprehensive insights.

---

## Image Processing and Analysis

- **Techniques for enhancing and interpreting imagery**:
  - **Preprocessing**: Geometric correction (aligning images to maps), radiometric correction (adjusting for sensor errors), and atmospheric correction (removing haze).
  - **Enhancement**: Contrast stretching or histogram equalization to improve visibility.
  - **Analysis**: Edge detection (e.g., identifying roads) or feature extraction (e.g., buildings in high-resolution imagery).
  - **Example**: Preprocessing Sentinel-1 SAR data in SNAP to remove speckle noise for clearer land cover mapping.

---

## Classification

- **Methods for categorizing remote sensing data**:
  - **Supervised**: Uses training data (e.g., Random Forest to classify land cover in Landsat imagery).
  - **Unsupervised**: Clusters pixels without prior labels (e.g., k-means for vegetation types).
  - **Object-Based**: Segments images into objects (e.g., eCognition for urban feature extraction).
  - **Example**: Classifying Sentinel-2 data to map forest, water, and urban areas.

---

## Change Detection

- **Identifying temporal changes in landscapes**: Compares multi-temporal images to detect changes. Techniques include:
  - **Image Differencing**: Subtracting pixel values (e.g., pre- and post-fire Landsat images).
  - **Post-Classification**: Comparing classified maps (e.g., deforestation over years).
  - **Example**: Using Sentinel-1 SAR to monitor urban expansion in cloudy regions.

---

## Spectral Indices

- **Tools for quantitative analysis**:
  - **NDVI**: \(\frac{NIR - Red}{NIR + Red}\), measures vegetation health (e.g., +1 for dense forests, -1 for water).
  - **NDWI**: \(\frac{Green - NIR}{Green + NIR}\), detects water bodies.
  - **EVI**: Enhanced Vegetation Index, corrects for atmospheric effects.
  - **Example**: NDVI from Sentinel-2 to monitor crop stress in a wheat field.
